Flexbox Layout:	
	
1. One-Dimensional Layout: Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layouts, either in a row (horizontal) or a column (vertical). It's excellent 			   for aligning items along a single axis.

2. Content-based Sizing: Flexbox is great for dynamically adjusting the size of elements based on their content or available space. It excels at 		         distributing space among items.

3. Ordering: Items can be reordered visually without changing their position in the DOM. This is done using the order property.

4. Alignment and Justification: Flexbox provides a range of properties (justify-content, align-items, etc.) for aligning and justifying items 			                within a container.

5.Responsive Design: Flexbox is particularly useful for creating flexible and responsive designs, especially for components like navigation bars, 		     lists, and card layouts.

Grid Layout:

1. Two-Dimensional Layout: Grid layout allows for both rows and columns, making it suitable for complex, grid-based layouts.

2. Explicit Grid Definition: It allows for explicit definition of rows and columns, allowing for more precise control over the layout.

3. Item Placement: Grid is good for placing items anywhere on the grid, which can be especially useful for complex, non-linear layouts.

4. Responsive by Default: Grid provides responsiveness by default, making it a strong choice for overall page layout.	

When to Use Each:
Flexbox:

Use Flexbox for smaller components within a layout, like navigation menus, lists, or card components.
When you need to align items along a single axis.

Grid Layout:

Use Grid for larger, more complex layouts, like overall page structure.
When you need precise control over both rows and columns.
When you're working with a grid-based design, like a gallery or a magazine layout.
